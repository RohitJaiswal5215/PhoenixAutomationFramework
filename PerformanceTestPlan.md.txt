Objective:
To evaluate the performance, scalability, and reliability of the application under different loads.

Scope:
- Measure response time of critical workflows (Login, Product Search, Checkout, API calls).
- Stress test APIs using JMeter / Postman.
- Analyze bottlenecks in UI Automation using Selenium with parallel execution (TestNG).

Tools:
- Apache JMeter
- Selenium Grid
- Postman (Collection Runner / Newman)

Key Metrics
- Response Time
- Throughput
- Error Rate
- CPU & Memory Usage

Scenarios
1. Login with 100 virtual users.
2. Search products with increasing load.
3. API `/employees` under stress (500+ requests/sec).
