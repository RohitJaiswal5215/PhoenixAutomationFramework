Security Test Plan

Objective:
To ensure the application is secure against vulnerabilities and meets standard security practices.

Scope:
- Web application security (UI).
- API security validation.
- Authentication & Authorization checks.

Tools:
- OWASP ZAP
- Postman (for API auth testing)
- Burp Suite (manual security testing)

Key Areas:
1. SQL Injection
2. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
3. Authentication bypass
4. API authorization testing
5. Sensitive data exposure

Scenarios:
- Verify login is secured with HTTPS.
- Validate API tokens and expired sessions.
- Test password reset with invalid inputs.
- Ensure no sensitive data is exposed in responses.
